# Bollinger-Bands-and-Stochastic-Oscillator-Trading-Strategy

Two trading strategies, the Bollinger Bands Strategy and a Momentum Trading Strategy using Stochastic Oscillator and MACD as leading indicators, are implemented in the following project. After implementing both strategies and backtesting using past data starting from 2018-01-01, while the Bollinger Bands strategy had minimal return, I was able to achieve a 50% better return using Stochastic Oscillator and MACD as leading indicator compared to a benchmark's(SPY ETF) return.
